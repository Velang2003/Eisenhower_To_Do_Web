# ✅ Eisenhower To-Do List

## 📌 Description
The **Eisenhower To-Do List** is a web-based task management application designed to help users **prioritize tasks** based on urgency and importance.  
This project was developed as a **final assignment for VaultofCodes**, showcasing my skills in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

It is based on the **Eisenhower Matrix**, a popular time management tool, categorizing tasks into four quadrants:

1. 🔴 **Urgent & Important** → Tasks that require immediate attention.  
2. 🟠 **Urgent & Not Important** → Pressing tasks with low long-term value.  
3. 🟢 **Not Urgent & Important** → Important but schedulable tasks.  
4. 🔵 **Not Urgent & Not Important** → Tasks that can be postponed or eliminated.
